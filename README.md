# spire

Pragmatic Provisioning

A Clojure domain specific language tailored to idempotently orchestrate machines in parallel over SSH.

## Overview

This is a **work in progress**. Consider everything liable to change at any time.

Spire is a single executable binary you can use to provision and configure remote Unix systems. It runs a Clojure _domain specific language_ that:

 * **Idempotent** Consists of a suite of idempotent operations that are easy to reason about.
 * **Just SSH** Machines don't need anything on them other than to have ssh running and have the standard Unix tools.
 * **Fast** Fast startup. Fast provisioning. For both low bandwidth and low latency connections.
 * **Simple** Separate, uncomplected parts that you can roll together in many different ways.
 * **Pragmatic** Operations performed in order. No graph building or ideological purity. Just do this. Then this. Then this.
 * **Easy Installation** Distributed as a single executable binary.
 * **Multiple Platforms** Can be used to provision any UNIX like system, from a Rasberry Pi to an Ubuntu VPS. **[WIP]**
 * **Clojure Power** Access to all the Clojure tools and data processing.
 * **Open Source** Access to the source code for ultimate peace of mind.

## Quickstart

    $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epiccastle/spire/master/scripts/install)
    $ spire -e '(ssh "localhost" (get-fact))'

## Platforms

### Native Client

This is the binary spire program you run on y our local machine.

 * [X] Linux 64 bit
 * [ ] MacOS 64 bit
 * [ ] Windows 64 bit

### Target Systems

This is the operating systems you will be provisioning, that the spire modules and operations will work against.

 * [X] Ubuntu Linux
 * [ ] FreeBSD
 * [ ] MacOS

## Build

Install graalvm-ce-19.2.1 in your home directory. Add the native image bundle to it. Then:

    $ make clean all

Or specify a path to the graal directory to build with a different graal:

    $ make clean all GRAALVM_HOME=/path/to/my/graal

After a long wait it should write a binary executable `spire`. Test it.

    $ ./spire -h

Install it.

    $ mv spire ~/bin/
    $ spire -h

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar spire-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Running with lein

Use trampoline to run with leiningen so libspire.so can read the correct terminal settings:

    $ lein trampoline run -- -h

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.
